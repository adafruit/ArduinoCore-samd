# Arduino Core for MCCI Catena&reg; IoT Nodes based on the SAMD21 CPU

This repository contains the source code and configuration files of the Arduino Core
for MCCI Catena IoT devices.  It is based on the Arduino core 
for Atmel's SAMD21 processor (used on the Arduino/Genuino Zero, MKR1000 and MKRZero boards),
as extended by Adafruit for their SAMD Boards such as the Feather M0.
